## Introduction

In a world where diseases often strike unexpectedly, awareness and education play pivotal roles in combating their impact. Recognizing this, our game, developed using Pygame, is not just about entertainment; it's a platform for spreading awareness about various diseases, aiming to educate players about their symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and treatment. By combining gameplay with informative content, we strive to engage players while empowering them with valuable knowledge about health and wellness.

## Social Cause

The underlying social cause behind our game is to address the lack of widespread understanding about various diseases prevalent in society. Many people may not have access to comprehensive information about diseases, leading to misconceptions, delayed diagnosis, and inadequate treatment. Moreover, stigma and fear often surround certain illnesses, hindering open discussions and preventive measures.

By leveraging the interactive nature of gaming, we seek to break down these barriers and foster a culture of awareness and understanding. Our game serves as a tool for initiating conversations about health, encouraging players to proactively learn about diseases, recognize their symptoms, and understand the importance of early intervention and treatment.

## Game Overview

Upon launching the game, players are greeted with a simple window featuring options to play or exit. Upon selecting the play button, they are presented with a selection of diseases to explore further. Each disease serves as a distinct level within the game, offering in-depth information and challenges related to that specific illness.

## Game Mechanics

1. Platform Gameplay: The core gameplay revolves around platform mechanics, where players control a character navigating through a hostile environment filled with disease-causing agents.

2. Combat System: Players are equipped with weapons such as guns and grenades to combat enemy cells representing the disease. The enemies fight back, adding an element of challenge and urgency to the gameplay.

3. Health System: The player character has a health bar that depletes upon sustaining damage from enemy cells. This mechanic emphasizes the importance of avoiding contact with pathogens and highlights the consequences of neglecting health precautions. Collect health boxes strategically placed throughout the levels to replenish your vitality and sustain your journey.

4. Information Collection: Scattered throughout the levels are mystery boxes containing informative points about the disease being explored. Players must collect these boxes to unlock valuable insights into the symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and treatment of the respective illness.

5. Audio Enhancements: Immerse yourself in the experience with background music that sets the tone for your adventure. Experience the thrill of the game with sound effects accompanying every action, from jumping and firing bullets to the explosive detonation of grenades.

6. Quiz Challenges: At the conclusion of each level, players face a quiz containing questions related to the disease they have just encountered. Correctly answering the quiz questions allows progression to the next level, while incorrect answers prompt players to revisit and reinforce their understanding of the disease.

7. Resource Management: To intensify the challenge, ammunition and grenades are limited and strategically placed throughout the levels. Keep an eye out for these precious resources, strategically balancing your usage to overcome obstacles and adversaries effectively.

## Educational Content

Each level of the game is meticulously crafted to provide comprehensive information about a specific disease. From detailing the symptoms and risk factors to exploring diagnostic methods and treatment options, players are immersed in a learning experience that transcends traditional educational approaches.
